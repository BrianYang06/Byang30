DISCO
- cancelAnimationFrame takes in an param that is returned by requestAnimationFrame
- c.width / c.height can be used to find height/width of canvas
- if you dont have cancelAnimationFrame in the start of drawDot then clicking the anim button will result in the anim speeding up

QCC
- What exactly does requestID return?
